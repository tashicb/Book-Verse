# 📚 BookVerse

BookVerse is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to discover, review, and share books with a passionate community. It includes user authentication, detailed book listings, star-based reviews, and a responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons.

### 🏗️ Architecture Decisions
- MERN Stack: We went with the classic MongoDB + Express + React + Node combo because it's all JavaScript end-to-end. That made things simpler and faster to build, especially for a small team or solo dev project.
- React Context API for Auth: Instead of pulling in something heavy like Redux, we used Context to manage the auth token globally. It keeps the code cleaner and still gets the job done efficiently.
- Tailwind CSS + Lucide Icons: Tailwind gave us the flexibility to style quickly without writing tons of CSS, and Lucide added clean, consistent icons that fit the modern vibe we were going for.
- JWT for Authentication: Using JSON Web Tokens helped us avoid the need for server-side sessions. It’s stateless, secure (as long as the token is protected), and easy to manage in a single-page app.
- Modular Structure: We kept the frontend and backend in separate folders to make the project easier to navigate, maintain, and eventually deploy. It’s also handy if we ever want to switch to mobile or build APIs separately.

### ⚠️ Known Limitations
❌ No pagination or infinite scrolling yet for book lists

🧪 No unit or integration tests implemented

🔐 JWT tokens stored in localStorage (can be improved with HttpOnly cookies)

🚫 No role-based access control (e.g., admin vs user)

🖼️ No book images or file uploads yet

📉 No analytics or activity tracking
